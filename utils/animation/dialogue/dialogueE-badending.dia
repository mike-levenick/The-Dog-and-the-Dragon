That night, the family sat and celebrated the little boy's birthday.

They served a feast with food the dog had helped grow.

But the dog slunk back to the barn with the other dogs that night.

They slept with the other dogs in the cold barn, which leaked.

As he slept, the dog sadly thought to himself, "I could not become a dragon...
...I am an utter and complete failure."

THE END
