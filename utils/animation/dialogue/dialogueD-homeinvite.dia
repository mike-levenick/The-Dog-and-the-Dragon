The farmer's wife hugs her son, and the farmer smiles down at you and pats you  on top of your head. 

"Good dog" you hear him say. 

You've heard this phrase before, but now that you know the human language, you  truly understand his words like you never could before.

The wife lets go of the son. The son then turns to you and smiles.

"It's my birthday! Do you want to come in to the house for dinner?"
