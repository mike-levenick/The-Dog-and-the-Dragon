The Dog and the Dragon is a text-based RPG, created by Mike Levenick,
and based on the short story The Dog and the Dragon, which is contained
within chapter 80 of the novel Rhythm of War, by Brandon Sanderson.

Much of the text used in the cutscenes was taken verbatim from the Dog and
the Dragon Worldsinger Edit, by u/ArtyWhy8. A hyperlink to their post is
contained within the ReadMe of this project.

This game is created in accordance with the Dragonsteel Entertainment fan-art
policy, which can be found on the Dragonsteel website. A hyperlink is contained
within the ReadMe of this project.

The animate.sh animation engine was inspired by the asciimation project by 
octobanana. asciimation can be found on GitHub, and a hyperlink is contained
within the ReadMe of this project.

The ASCII art used in this project can be found at https://www.asciiart.eu/
Some of the art has been slightly modified by me in order to fit the project.

The code for this project is released under the GNU AGPL v3 license, although
it is important to note that commercial use of Brandon Sanderson's literary
works are not allowed without permission of Dragonsteel Entertainment.
