The dog chose the scales first, as it seemed the easiest, and he wanted to 
begin his transformation with an early victory. 

He knew the farmer owned many seeds in a variety of colors, and they were 
the shape of little scales. 

Because he was not a thief, the dog did not take theseâ€”but he asked the 
other animals where the farmer obtained new ones.

It turns out, the farmer could make seeds by putting them in the ground, 
waiting for plants to grow, then taking more seeds from the stalks.
